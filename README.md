# Tookhome Netflix

Progressive Enhancement is the art of delivering content by importance. The most important things happen first and less important things come later.

For any high traffic website, this discipline is the difference between millions of dollars and tens of dollars. Categorically, web surfers are impatient.

In wartime, the difference is lives. Access to information is critical. Missing information is costly and misinformation is lethal.

For Netflix, the homepage has been dialed in. Any impact to make things take any longer than they already do will likely fail at beating out the current iteration.

One hackday project I built was to animate the box art in the background of the homepage.

Using a few game optimization techniques, namely spriting and compositing, this could be done without impacting core metrics.

I spent much of the pandemic crafting an approach to this solve this type of problem in a maintainable way.

Due to a myriad of circumstances, I was never able to fully articulate this concept as my day job at Netflix.

For my first takehome interview after Netflix the task was very similar to my animated box art hackday.

Feeling inspired, I merged the compositing from the takehome and the animated box art spriting.

As an easter egg, I added the instrument mod from my game engine as a plug for my computer startup.
